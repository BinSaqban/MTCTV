How to Interpret and Use the MTC Indicator
Background Color: The light green/red background instantly tells you the primary trend according to the long-term EMA.
Light Green: Price is above the 200 EMA (Uptrend).
Light Red: Price is below the 200 EMA (Downtrend).
The Lines:
Thick Blue Line: Your long-term trend filter (200 EMA). The strategy is to look for buys above this line and sells below it.
Green/Red Lines: Your fast (20) and slow (50) EMAs. The crossover between these is your entry trigger.
The Signals (BUY/SELL Labels):
A "BUY" label appears only when all four conditions are met. This suggests a strong, high-probability entry point to go long.
A "SELL" label appears only when all four bearish conditions are met. This suggests a strong entry point to go short.
Trading Strategy Example:
Wait for a Signal: Be patient. Don't trade unless you see a clear BUY or SELL label.
Enter a Trade: When a BUY label appears, you can enter a long position. When a SELL label appears, you can enter a short position.
Set a Stop-Loss: Always use a stop-loss! A good place could be below the low of the signal candle (for a buy) or above the high of the signal candle (for a sell).
Take Profit: You can take profit at a predetermined risk/reward ratio (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1), or when you see a contrary signal (e.g., a SELL signal appears while you are in a long trade).
Setting Up Alerts
This indicator has built-in alert conditions, which is one of its most powerful features.

On your chart, click on "Alerts" (the bell icon).
Click "Create New Alert."
In the "Condition" dropdown, find the "Momentum Trend Confirmation (MTC)" indicator.
Select either "MTC Buy Alert" or "MTC Sell Alert."
Configure the rest of your alert settings (e.g., notifications) and click "Create."
Now, TradingView will automatically send you a notification whenever a high-probability signal occurs, even if you're not watching the chart!

Customization
The best part about building your own indicator is that you can tweak the inputs. Feel free to experiment with:

Changing the EMA lengths.
Adjusting the RSI midline (e.g., 40 for a more sensitive bullish signal).
Changing the volume multiplier to require a bigger or smaller volume spike.
This indicator provides a solid, logical framework for identifying momentum-based trend continuations. Happy trading
