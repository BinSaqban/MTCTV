The Indicator: Momentum Trend Confirmation (MTC)
Core Concept
The MTC indicator will only generate a BUY signal when:

The price is above a long-term trend EMA (e.g., 200).
The RSI momentum indicator shows bullish strength (e.g., above 50).
A short-term EMA crosses above a medium-term EMA (e.g., 20 crosses 50).
The volume of the signal candle is significantly higher than its average.
It will only generate a SELL signal when the opposite conditions are met.
